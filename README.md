# Backend And Cross-Tech-Stack Spec Skill Library

This repository is an open skill library for code knowledge mapping, legacy-system understanding, central knowledge-repository building, and mixed-stack project analysis.

It is built by drawing on selected ideas and working principles from zread and sdd-riper, then upgrading and extending them into a more team-oriented skill library for long-term project knowledge reuse, cross-service analysis, mixed-stack mapping, and central knowledge-base maintenance.

## Chinese README

For Chinese readers, start here:

- [README.zh-CN.md](./README.zh-CN.md)

It is organized around two sibling skills maintained in one place:

1. `backend-service-spec-skill`
2. `cross-tech-stack-spec-skill`

The goal is to keep backend-oriented knowledge mapping and cross-tech-stack extensions in a single repository so they are easier to maintain, publish, and read.

## Important Note

The base skill and the extension skill now both use their formal names directly:

- `backend-service-spec-skill`
- `cross-tech-stack-spec-skill`

That means users should now invoke the base skill directly by its current formal name.

For example:

```text
Use $backend-service-spec-skill to analyze this backend microservice project.
```

## Quick Start Here

If this is your first time in the repository, use this root README as the entry guide:

1. Read this file to understand the two skills, their boundaries, and the common entry prompts.
2. If your target is a backend, microservice, legacy system, or platform service repository, continue with the [Backend Service Spec Skill README](./backend-service-spec-skill/README.md).
3. If your target is mobile, H5, Python, or a mixed-stack workspace, continue with the [Cross Tech Stack Spec Skill README](./cross-tech-stack-spec-skill/README.md).

If you mainly want to know what `backend-service-spec-skill` can do before reading the full child README, start with the command overview below.

## `backend-service-spec-skill` At A Glance

This is the primary skill in the repository for backend systems, microservice landscapes, legacy codebases, and platform-style service repositories.

### 1. `create_codemap`

Use it when:

- you need a first-pass service landscape
- you want to identify which services deserve deeper analysis next

Typical outputs:

- service inventory
- service boundaries
- upstream/downstream dependencies
- service-landscape overview pages
- architecture diagram and service call graph by default in a standard run

- [Backend Service Spec Skill README](./backend-service-spec-skill/README.md)
- [Backend Skill Command Output Map](./backend-service-spec-skill/references/command-output-map.md)

### 2. `service_deep_dive`

Use it when:

- you have identified a high-value service
- you want a vertical analysis of modules, interfaces, dependencies, and responsibilities

Typical outputs:

- single-service structure pages
- interface inventory
- dependency pages
- service rule or convention pages
- upstream/downstream dependency diagram and module architecture diagram by default in a standard run

Read more:

- [Backend Service Spec Skill README](./backend-service-spec-skill/README.md)
- [Backend Skill Quick Start](./backend-service-spec-skill/references/quick-start.md)

### 3. `crate_router_map`

Use it when:

- you want to trace a real request chain or message chain
- you need to separate sync calls, async messaging, compensation, and real-time channels

Typical outputs:

- key route-chain pages
- sync/async split views
- closure-status pages
- sequence diagram and route call graph by default in a standard run

Read more:

- [Backend Service Spec Skill README](./backend-service-spec-skill/README.md)
- [Backend Skill Command Quick Reference](./backend-service-spec-skill/references/command-output-scenario-quickref.md)

### 4. `build_domain_map`

Use it when:

- you already have service-level facts and want to consolidate them into domain-level knowledge
- you are preparing long-lived artifacts for a central knowledge repository

Typical outputs:

- business-domain pages
- domain-to-service mapping pages
- domain-level rule pages
- domain context diagram by default in a standard run

Default output rule:

- for the four backend core commands, a standard-output run now means `text pages + companion Markdown/Mermaid diagrams`
- users only need to call out diagrams separately when they want narrower scope, special naming, or text-only output

## One-Line Selection Guide

- For the overall service landscape: start with `create_codemap`
- For one important service: start with `service_deep_dive`
- For a real cross-service chain: start with `crate_router_map`
- For long-lived domain knowledge: finish with `build_domain_map`
- For mixed-stack projects: use `$backend-service-spec-skill` as the base workflow and enable `$cross-tech-stack-spec-skill`

## `cross-tech-stack-spec-skill` Diagram Snapshot

When the extension skill runs as a standard-output mixed-stack pass, companion Markdown/Mermaid diagrams should normally be generated together with the text pages.

Typical default diagrams:

- mixed-stack architecture diagram
- cross-layer call graph
- page/app/backend/task/callback/bridge sequence diagram when a route needs explicit ordering
- interface mapping diagram when `enable_contract_map` is enabled and evidence supports it
- gateway forwarding diagram when `enable_gateway_map` is enabled
- context propagation diagram when `enable_context_propagation_map` is enabled
- producer/topic/consumer route diagram when `enable_async_contract_map` is enabled

## How To Choose

### Use only `$backend-service-spec-skill` when:

- the repository is mainly backend or microservice oriented
- service-level language is still accurate enough
- cross-stack adaptation is not needed

### Use `$cross-tech-stack-spec-skill` when:

- the repository is mobile-first, H5-first, Python-first, or mixed-stack
- interface and router analysis must cross frontend, gateway, backend, MQ, callback, or task layers
- backend-only wording would distort the project structure

### Use both together when:

- you want the backend skill as the main workflow
- and you need mixed-stack adaptation on top of it

Recommended wording:

```text
Use $backend-service-spec-skill as the base workflow, and enable $cross-tech-stack-spec-skill for mixed-stack adaptation.
```

```

Note:

- full analysis mode can consume substantially more tokens
- it also increases scan time and output size
- see [Full Analysis Mode](./references/full-analysis-mode.md) for guidance
